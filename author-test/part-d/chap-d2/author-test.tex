\abstract*{Since the positive cone of a C*-algebra has non-empty interior many results of Chapter B-II can be applied verbatim to the characterization of the generator of positive semigroups on C*-algebras.
On the other hand a concrete and detailed representation of such generators has been found only in the uniformly continuous case (see Lindblad (1976)).
A third area of active research has been the following: Which maps on C*-algebras (in particular, which derivations) commuting with certain automorphism groups are automatically generators of strongly continuous positive semigroups.
For more information we refer to the survey article of Evans~\cite{evans:1984}.}
