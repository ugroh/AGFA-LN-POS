\part{ONE-PARAMETER SEMIGROUPS ON BANACH SPACES}
\chapter{BASIC RESULTS ON SEMIGROUPS ON BANACH SPACES}
by Rainer Nagel and Ulf Schlotterbeck
Since the basic theory of one-parameter semigroups can be found in several excellent books (e.g. [Davies (1980)], [Goldstein (1985a)], [Pazy (1983)] or [Hille-Phillips (1957)]) we do not want to give a self-contained introduction to this subject here.
It may however be useful to fix our notation, to collect briefly some important definitions and results (Section 1), to present a list of standard examples (Section 2) and to discuss standard constructions of new semigroups from a given one (Section 3).
In the entire chapter we denote by $E$ a (real or) complex Banach space and consider one-parameter semigroups of bounded linear operators $T(t)$ on $E$.
By this we understand a subset ${T(t) : t \in \mathbb{R}{+}}$ of $L(E)$, usually written as $(T(t)){t \geq 0}$, such that:

\[
	T(0) = \text{Id},

\[
	T(s+t) = T(s) \cdot T(t) \text{ for all } s, t \in \mathbb{R}_{+}
\]

In more abstract terms this means that the map $t \mapsto T(t)$ is a homomorphism from the additive semigroup $(\mathbb{R}_{+},+)$ into the multiplicative semigroup $(L(E),\cdot)$.
Similarly, a one-parameter group will be a homomorphic image of the group $(\mathbb{R},+)$ in $(L(E),\cdot)$.

\section{STANDARD DEFINITIONS AND RESULTS}
We consider a one-parameter semigroup $(T(t)){t \geq 0}$ on a Banach space $E$ and observe that the domain $\mathbb{R}{+}$ and the range $L(E)$ of the (semi-
