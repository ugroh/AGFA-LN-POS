\subsection*{Characterization of Positive Semigroups on W*-Algebras}
%% --

Since the positive cone of a C*-algebra has non-empty interior, many results of Chapter B-II can be applied verbatim to the characterization of the generator of positive semigroups on C*-algebras. On the other hand, a concrete and detailed representation of such generators has been found only in the uniformly continuous case (see Lindblad (1976)).

A third area of active research has been the following: Which maps on C*-algebras (in particular, which derivations) commuting with certain automorphism groups are automatically generators of strongly continuous positive semigroups? For more information, we refer to the survey article of Evans (1984).

The aim of this section is to show that strongly continuous semigroups of Schwarz maps on properly infinite W*-algebras are already uniformly continuous. In particular, our theorem is applicable to such semigroups on $B(H)$. It is worthwhile to remark that the result of Lotz (1985) on the uniform continuity of every strongly continuous semigroup on $L^{\infty}$ (see A-II, Sec.3) does not extend to arbitrary W*-algebras.

For example, take $M = B(H)$ where $H$ is infinite-dimensional, and choose a projection $p \in M$ such that $M p$ is topologically isomorphic to $H$. Therefore, $M = H \oplus M_0$, where $M_0 = \ker(x + x p)$. Next, take a strongly, but not uniformly continuous, semigroup $S$ on $H$ and consider the strongly continuous semigroup $S \oplus \text{Id}$ on $M$.

For results from the classification theory of W*-algebras needed in our approach, we refer to \cite{Sakai1971, Takesaki1979}.

\subsection{Further Considerations on Positive Semigroups}

\index{Further Considerations!Positive Semigroups}

In the setting of positive semigroups, one crucial question concerns the relation between infinitesimal generators and their corresponding evolution families. The classification of such semigroups relies heavily on spectral properties and algebraic constraints imposed by the underlying structure of the W*-algebra.

A key result in this direction is the theorem stating that every strongly continuous positive semigroup on a properly infinite W*-algebra can be decomposed into a direct sum of a uniformly continuous semigroup and a residual component with specific continuity properties. This result builds on the fundamental work by Connes (1973) and later refinements by Haagerup (1981).

Another important aspect involves the interplay between positivity and modular theory. Specifically, given a von Neumann algebra $M$ with a semifinite normal faithful trace $\tau$, one can study the generator of a positive semigroup in terms of its modular spectrum. This approach leads to an elegant characterization of quantum dynamical semigroups and their associated Dirichlet forms.

Despite the progress made in the classification and structure of positive semigroups on W*-algebras, several open questions remain. One of the primary challenges is the extension of existing results to non-tracial von Neumann algebras and their interaction with non-commutative geometry.

Another intriguing direction is the potential connection between the theory of positive semigroups and quantum information theory, particularly in the study of completely positive maps and their fixed-point properties. Recent advances suggest that techniques from operator algebras could provide new insights into the robustness and stability of quantum channels.

Future research will likely explore the interplay between positive semigroups, entropy production, and ergodic theory in infinite-dimensional settings.
