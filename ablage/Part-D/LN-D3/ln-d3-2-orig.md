such that

\[
\left\|x_{n}-x_{m}\right\| \leq \frac{\delta}{2}
\]

which leads to a contradiction. Therefore every approximate eigenvector of $(\lambda-i \alpha) R(\lambda)$ pertaining to $I$ is relatively compact. In particular it has a convergent subsequence from which it follows that the fixed space of $(\lambda-i \alpha) R(\lambda)$ is non trivial.
obviously

\[
dim Fix((\lambda-ia)R(\lambda)) E dim Fix((\lambda - ialåº³(\lambda)).
\]

If the last inequality is strict, then there exists $\gamma>0$ and $a$ normalized $\hat{x} \in F i x(\lambda-i \alpha) \hat{R}(\lambda))$ such that

\[
\gamma \leqslant \| \hat{y}-\left.\hat{x}\right|_{i} ^{n}
\]

for all $y \in F i x((\lambda-i G) R(\lambda))$. Take a normalized sequence ( $\left.x_{n}\right) \in \hat{X}$. Then $\left(x_{n}\right)$ has a convergent subsequence whence we may assume that Iim $_{n} x_{n}=z$ exists in $E$. Thus $0 \neq z \in F i x((\lambda-i \alpha) R(\lambda))$. From this we obtain the contradiction

\[
\gamma \leq\|\hat{z}-\hat{x}\|_{j}=\lim \left\|z-x_{n}\right\|=0
\]

Consequently

\[
\operatorname{dim} F i x((\lambda-i a) R(\lambda))=\operatorname{dim} F i x(\lambda-i a) \operatorname{R}(\lambda))
\]

Let $\left\{x_{1}, \ldots x_{n}\right\}$ be a base of Fix( $\lambda$ - ialR(X)) and choose $\left\{\phi_{1} \ldots \phi_{n}\right\}$ in Fix( $\lambda$ - ia)R(i) $\left.{ }^{\prime}\right)$ such that $\phi_{k}\left(x_{j}\right)=\delta_{k, j}$ (Lemma 1.6). Then

\[
E=\operatorname{Fix}((\lambda-i \alpha) R(\lambda)) \quad \oplus \quad\left(\cap \underset{j=1}{n} \operatorname{ker}_{j}\right)
\]

where both subspaces on the right are ( $A$ - ia)R(A)-invariant and I is a pole of $(\lambda-i \alpha) R(\lambda) \mid F i x((\lambda-i a) R(\lambda))$ by the finite dimensionality of $F i x((\lambda-i a) R(\lambda))$. Suppose $I$ belongs to the spectrum of $S$ where $S$ is the restriction of ( $\lambda$-io) R( $\lambda$ ) to $n_{j=1}^{n}$ ker ${ }_{j}$. Then there

\[
\lim _{n}\left\|(\lambda-i \Omega) R(\lambda) Y_{n}-Y_{n}\right\|=0 .
\]

Therefore $\left(y_{n}\right)$ has an accumulation point different from zero in

\[
\text { Fix }(\lambda-i a) R(\lambda)) \quad \Gamma\left(n_{j=1}^{n} \operatorname{ker}_{j}\right)
\]

This contradiction implies that $I$ does not belong to the spectrum of $S$. Since Fix ( $\lambda$ - ialR( $\lambda]$ ) is finite dimensional, it follows from general spectral theory that $(\lambda-i \alpha)^{-1}$ is a pole of $R(. r R(\lambda))$ for every $\lambda$. Thus (a) and (b) are proved. Assertion (c) follows from the resolvent equality as in the proof of [Greiner (198I), Proposition I.2].

Proposition 2.3. Let $T$ be a semigroup of contractions on a Banach space $E$ with generator $A$. Then the following assertions are equivalent:
(a) Each io, a $\in \mathbb{R}$, is a pole of the resolvent $R(., A)$ such that the corresponding residue has finite rank.
(b) dim Fix ( $\lambda-\operatorname{ial} \hat{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, A))<\infty$ for some (hence all) $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$, Re $(\lambda)>0$ and the canonical extensions $\hat{R}(\lambda, A)$ of $R(\lambda, A)$ to some ultrapower.

Proof. Let $P_{a}$ be the residue of the resolvent $R(\ldots A)$ in ia. Then $P_{\alpha}=\operatorname{Iim}_{\lambda \rightarrow i \alpha}(\lambda-i \alpha) R(\lambda, A)$ in the operator norm of $L(E)$. Since the canonical map $(T \rightarrow \hat{T})$ is isometric and since $\hat{E}$ is an ultrapower, we obtain

\[
\hat{\mathrm{P}}_{\alpha}=1 \mathrm{im}_{\lambda \rightarrow i \alpha}(\lambda-i \alpha) \hat{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda, A)
\]

in $\left[(\hat{E})\right.$ and $\operatorname{rank}\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{o}}\right)=\operatorname{rank}\left(\hat{\mathrm{P}}_{\mathrm{a}}\right)$. Because of

\[
\hat{P}_{a}(\hat{\mathrm{E}})=F \operatorname{Fix}((\lambda-\mathrm{i} \alpha) \hat{\mathrm{R}}(\lambda))
\]

one part of the corollary is proved. The other follows from Lemma 2.2.

Remarks 2.4. (a) By the results in [Lin (1974)] a semigroup of contractions on a Banach space is uniformly ergodic if and only if 0 is a pole of the generator with order $\leq 1$. The resicue of the resolvent in 0 and the associated ergodic projection are identical.
(b) Let $M$ be a $W^{*-a l g e b r a ~ w i t h ~ p r e d u a l ~} M_{*}$, $U$ a free ultrafilter on $N$ and $M$ (resp. $\left.\left(M_{*}\right)^{\wedge}\right)$ the ultrapower of $M$ (resp. $M_{*}$ ) with respect to $U$. Then it is easy to see that $c_{U}(M)$ is a two sided

For $\hat{x} \in \hat{M}$ and $\hat{\phi} \in\left(M_{*}\right)$ - Iet $J:\left(M_{*}\right) \cdots \rightarrow \hat{M r}$ be defined by

\[
\langle\hat{x}, y(\hat{\phi})\rangle:=\lim _{U^{\phi}}\left(x_{n}\right),\left(x_{n}\right) \in \hat{x},\left(\phi_{n}\right) \in \hat{\phi} .
\]

$J$ is well defined and is an isometric embedding. It turns out that $\left.J\left(M_{*}\right)^{n}\right)$ is a translation invariant subspace of (M')~. Hence there exists a central projection $z \in \mathcal{M}^{+\prime}$ such that $\left.J\left(M_{k}\right)^{\prime}\right)=\hat{M}^{\prime \prime} z \quad$ [Groh (1984), Proposition 2.2].

Below we identify ( $M_{*}$ ) via $J$ with this translation invariant subspace. From the construction the following is obvious: If $T$ is an identity preserving schwarz map with preadjoint $T_{*} \in L\left(M_{*}\right)$, then $T$ is an identity preserving Schwarz map on $M$ such that ( $\left.T_{*}\right)^{\wedge}=$

Theorem 2.5. Let $T$ be an identity preserving semigroup of schwarz type with generator $A$ on the predual of a $W^{*}-a l g e b r a \quad M$. If $T$ is uniformly ergodic with finite dimensional fixed space, then every $\gamma \in \sigma(A) \cap i R$ is a pole of the resolvent $R(\ldots, A)$ and dim ker $(\gamma-A) \leqq$ dim Fix( ${ }^{T}$ ).

Proof Let $D=\{\lambda \in \mathbb{C}: \operatorname{Re}(\lambda)>0\}$ and $R$ the $M_{*}$-valued pseudoresolvent of Schwarz type induced by $R(., A)$ on $D$. Then

\[
P=\lim _{\mu \neq 0} \mu \mathrm{R}(\mu)
\]

exists in the uniform operator topology and rank $(P)=\operatorname{dim} F i x(T)<\infty$. From this we obtain rank $(P)=\operatorname{rank}(\hat{P})<\infty$ where $\hat{P}$ is the canonical extension of $P$ onto $\left(M_{*}\right)^{n}$. Since $\hat{P}=1$ im $_{\mu+0} \mu R(\mu)^{n}$ it follows that

\[
\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{Fix}((\lambda-i a) \hat{R}(\lambda)) \leq \operatorname{rank}(\hat{P})<\infty
\]

(Proposition 2.1) for all $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$. Therefore the assertion follows from Lemma 2.2.

The consequences of this result for the asymptotic behavior of one-parameter semigroups will be discussed in D-IV, Section 4 .

NOTES.
Section 1. The Perron-Frobenius theory for a aingle positive operator on a non-commutative operator algebra is worked out in Albeverio-H\&egh-Krohn (1978) and Groh (1981). The limitations of the theory (in the continuous as fin the discrete case)
are explained by the example following Remark 1.9 (see also Groh (1982a)). Therefore we concentrate on irreducible semigroupa. Our main result (Theorem 1.10 ) extends B-III, Thm. 3.6 to the non-commutative aetting.

Section 2. Theorem 2.5 has its roots in the Niiro-Sawashima Theorem for a single irreducible positive operator or a Banach lattice (see Schaefer (1974), V.5.4). The analogous semigroup result on Banach lattices is due to Greiner (1982). The ultrapower technique in our proof is developed in Groh (1984b).
