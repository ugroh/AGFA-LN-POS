# CHARACTERIZATIONOFOPOSITIVE

since the positive cone of a C*-algebra has non-empty interior many results of Chapter B-II can be applied verbatim to the characterization of the generator of positive semigroups on $c^{*}$ other hand a concret and detailed representation of such generators has been found only in the uniformly continupus case (see Lindblad (1976)).

A third area of active research has been the following: Which maps on $C^{*}$-algebras (in particular, which derivations) commuting with certain automorphism groups are automatically generators of strongly continuous positive semigroups. For more informations we refer to the survey article of Evans (1984).

## 1. POSITIVE SEMIGROUPS ON PROPERLY INFINITE W*-ALGEBRAS

The aim of this section is to show that strongly continuous semigroups of schwarz maps on properly infinite $W^{*}$-algebras are already uniformly continuous. In particular, our theorem is applicable to such semigroups on $B(H)$. It is worthwhile to remark, that the result of Lotz (1985) on the uniformly continuity of every strongly continuous semigroup on $L^{m}$ (see A-II, sec.3) does not extend to arbitrary $W^{*}$ algebras. For example, take $M=B(H), H$ infinite dimensional, and choose a projection $p \in M$ such that $M p$ is topologically isomorphic to $H$. Therefore $M=H \oplus M_{o}$, where $M_{o}=k e r(x \rightarrow x p)$. Next take a strongly, but not uniformly continuous, semigroup $S$ on $H$ and consider the strongly continuous semigroup $S \oplus \mathrm{Id}$ on M .
our approach we refer to [Sakai (1971), 2.2] and [Takesaki (1979), V.1].

Theorem 1.l. Every strongly continuous one-parameter semigroup of Schwarz type on a properly infinite $W^{*}$-algebra $M$ is uniformly contÃ­ nuous.

Proof, Let $T=\left(T(t)_{*}{ }^{\prime}{ }_{t \geq 0}\right.$ be strongly continuous on $M$ and suppose $T$ not to be uniformly continuous. Then there exists a sequence ( $T_{n}$ ) $c T$ and $E>0$ such that $\left\|T_{n}-I d\right\| \geqslant \varepsilon$ but $T_{n} \rightarrow I d$ in the strong operator topology. We claim that for every sequence ( $p_{k}$ ) of mutually orthogonal projections and all bounded sequences $\left(x_{k}\right)$ in $M$

\[
1 i m m_{n}\left\|\left(\mathrm{~T}_{\mathrm{n}}-\mathrm{Id}\right)\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{k}} \mathrm{x}_{\mathrm{k}} \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{k}}\right)\right\|=0
\]

uniformly in $k \in \mathbb{N}$. This follows from an application of the Lemma of Phillips and the fact that the sequence ( $P_{k} x_{k} P_{k}$ ) is sumable in the $\mathrm{s}^{*}\left(\mathrm{M}, \mathrm{M}_{*}\right)$-topology (compare Elliot (I972)).

Let ( $p_{k}$ ) be a sequence of mutually orthogonal projections in $M$ such that every $P_{k}$ is equivalent to 1 via some $u_{k} \in M$ [Sakai (1971), 2.2].

Without loss of generality we may assume $\left\|\left(T_{n}-r d\right)\left(u_{n}\right)\right\| \leqq n^{-1}$ since the semigroup $T$ is strongly continuous. Thus we obtained the following:
(1) $\quad 1 i m{ }_{n}\left\|\left(T_{n}-I d\right)\left(P_{k} X_{k} P_{k}\right)\right\|=0$ uniformily in $k \in \mathbb{N}$ for every bounded sequence $\left(x_{k}\right)$ in $M$.
(2) Every projection $P_{k}$ is equivalent to 1 via some $u_{k} \in M$.
(3) $\left\|\left(T_{n}-1 d\right) u_{n}\right\| n^{-1}$ for all $n \in \epsilon^{2}$.

For the following construction see $A-1,3,6$ and $D-I I, S e c .2$.

Let $\hat{M}$ be an ultrapower of $M, \operatorname{let} P:=\left(p_{k}\right)^{\wedge} \hat{M}, T:=\left(T{ }_{n}\right) \wedge \in(\hat{M})$ and $u:=\left(u_{k}\right)^{\wedge} \in \hat{M}$. Then $T$ is identity preserving and of schwarz type on $\hat{M}$. Since $u^{*} u=p$ and $u^{*}=1$, it follows pu* $=u *$ and (un*) $x\left(u^{*}\right)=x$ for all $x \in \hat{M}$. Finally, $T(p x p)=$ pxp for all $x \in \hat{M}$, which follows from (I), and $T\left(u^{*}\right)=T\left(p u^{*}\right)=p u^{*}=u^{*}$ and $T(u)=u$, which follows from (3). Using the schwarz inequality we obtain

\[
T\left(u u^{*}\right)=T(1) \leq 1=u u^{*}=T(u) T(u)^{*} .
\]

Using $D-I I T$, Lemma 1.1 . we concIude $T(u x)=u T(x)$ and $T\left(x u^{*}\right)=$ $T(x) u^{*}$ for all $x \in \hat{M}$. Hence
$T(x)=T\left(u u^{*} x u u^{*}\right)=u T\left(u^{*} x u\right) u^{*}=u T\left(p u^{*} x u p\right) u^{*}=$
$=u p u^{*} x u p u^{*}=u u^{*} x u u^{*}=x$
for all $x(\bar{M}$. From this we obtain that for every bounded sequence
