An overview on positive operators on operator algebras can be found in \mycite{zbMATH06128372}, but there seems to be no systematic reference for general positive 
$C_{0}$-semigroups on operator algebras.
However, many papers deal with Markov semigroups (see, \eg \mycite{zbMATH03762672}) or with so-called E-semigroups
(see \mycite{zbMATH01949821})

\begin{enumerate}

\item 
As we have seen in Chapter A-II, Section 3, strongly continuous semigroups on commutative \WA-algebras, that is, on $L^{\infty}$, are already norm-continuous. 
The proof depends heavily on the Grothendieck property (GP) and the Dunford-Pettis property (DPP) of these Banach spaces. 
It was shown by \mycite{zbMATH00537321} that every \WA-algebra has (GP) (see also \mycite{zbMATH00125315} for an alternative proof).
On the other hand, for a \WA-algebra $M$ the following are equivalent.

\begin{enumerate}[\upshape(a)]
    \item The \WA-algebra $M$ is of type I finite.
    \item The \WA-algebra $M$ has (DPP).
    \item The predual $M_{*}$ has (DPP).
\end{enumerate}

(see \mycite{zbMATH00125315} and \mycite{zbMATH00097659}).
Thus, as a consequence of A-II Theorem 3.5, strongly continuous semigroups on type I finite \WA-algebras always have a bounded generator. 

\item
\mycite{zbMATH01495754} has shown that for sequences of completely positive maps, strong and norm convergence to the identity operator are equivalent on \WA-algebras (even on the larger class of \AW-algebras).
Therefore, a strongly continuous $C_{0}$-semigroup of completely positive operators on a \WA-algebra is norm-continuous and thus has a bounded generator.

\item 
In \mycite{zbMATH00097715} it is shown that $C(K)$ has the Grothendieck property if and only if each strongly continuous semigroup has a bounded generator. 

If every strongly continuous $C_{0}$-semigroup on a noncommutative \CA-algebra $M$ has a bounded generator, then it is still true that this algebra is a Grothendieck space. 
To prove this, one uses the fact that a \CA-algebra is a Grothendieck space if and only if $c_{0}$ is not a complemented subspace (see \mycite[Prop. 3.1.13 \& 4.2.1]{zbMATH07458830}).

Indeed, suppose that every strongly continuous $C_{0}$-semigroup on $M$ has a bounded generator, but $c_{0}$ is a complemented subspace of $M$.
Then $M = c_{0} \oplus F$ for some closed subspace $F$ of $M$.
Take a strongly continuous but not uniformly continuous $C_{0}$-semigroup $\{T(t)\}$ on $c_{0}$ and let $S(t) = T(t) \oplus Id_{F}$ on $M$. 
Then $\{S(t)\}$ is strongly continuous but not uniformly continuous on $M$, contradicting our assumption.

Note that on $\L{H}$ with $H$ an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, there always exist strongly but not uniformly continuous $C_{0}$-semigroups, yet this \WA-algebra is a Grothendieck space (see the example at the beginning of D-II).

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Since the cone of the self-adjoint, positive elements of a \CA-algebra is a normal cone, one can derive properties such as $s(A) \in \sigma(A)$ or $s(A) = \omega_{0}$ from the theory of semigroups of positive operators on ordered Banach spaces with such cones; see \mycite{zbMATH03883065} or \mycite{zbMATH03736445}.
%But to remain in the category of \CA-algebras, we have summarized this using \CA-algebra methods in a preprint.

\item 
While \WA-algebras are not stable under ultraproduct construction, see \mycite[p. 79]{zbMATH03640303} or \mycite{zbMATH03467832}, their preduals are and can be used for spectral theoretical purposes. 
More on ultraproducts of \WA-algebras can be found in \mycite{zbMATH06326930}.

\item 
Another approach to the spectral theory on \WA-algebras is in \mycite{zbMATH06031834}, where a Jacobs-de Leeuw-Glicksberg decomposition is constructed.
This leads to a noncommutative version of the Perron-Frobenius theorem for \WA-algebras and is applied to the asymptotics of \WA-dynamical systems.
A similar approach is in \mycite{zbMATH06728793}.

As in D-III, results from \citeEN{zbMATH07964911} on semigroups on ordered Banach spaces with a normal cone and order unit can be applied. 
More precise results on \WA-algebras and their preduals are in \mycite{zbMATH02244715}.
Specific investigations focus on \emph{Quantum Markov semigroups and decoherence} (see, \eg, \mycite{zbMATH08072228}) or on \emph{Spectral gaps and convergence to equilibrium} (see, \eg \mycite{zbMATH06737571}).
