As in D-III, results from \citeEN{zbMATH07964911} on semigroups on ordered Banach spaces with a normal cone and order unit can be applied. 
More precise results on \WA-algebras and their preduals are in \mycite{zbMATH02244715}.
Specific investigations focus on \emph{Quantum Markov semigroups and decoherence} (see, \eg, \mycite{zbMATH08072228}) or on \emph{Spectral gaps and convergence to equilibrium} (see, \eg \mycite{zbMATH06737571}).
