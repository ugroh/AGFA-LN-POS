\section[Positive semigroups generated by elliptic operators]{Positive semigroups generated by elliptic operators on spaces of continuous functions}
\label{sec:eb2-1}
Important examples of semigroups on $C_{0}(\Omega)$ or $C(\overline{\Omega})$, where $\Omega \subset \R^n$ is open and bounded, are generated by elliptic differential operators. 
In the following we put together a series of results starting with the Laplacian subject to Dirichlet and to Robin boundary conditions and ending with the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator on $C(\Omega)$. 
Each time we obtain a positive irreducible semigroup. We consider $\mathbb{K} = \R$ throughout this section.

\subsection{The Laplacian}
%% --
Let $\Omega \subset \R^d$ be open and bounded. We say that $\Omega$ is \emph{Dirichlet-regular} if for every $g \in C(\Omega)$ there exists a (unique) function $u \in C(\overline{\Omega}) \cap C^{2}(\Omega)$ such that
%% --
\begin{align*}
 	\Delta u &= 0 \quad \text{and} \\
	u_{|_{\Omega}} &= g.
\end{align*} 
%% --
This means that the Dirichlet problem is well-posed. 
This property is very well understood and precise characterizations in terms of barriers or of capacity are known. 
If $\Omega$ has Lipschitz boundary, then $\Omega$ is Dirichlet regular. 
In dimension $d = 2$ it suffices that $\Omega$ is simply connected.

We refer to \citet[Section 6.9]{Au23} or \citet[Section 2.8]{GT83} for further information on the Dirichlet Problem. 

The Dirichlet Laplacian $\Delta_{0}$ on $C_{0}(\Omega)$ is defined by
%% --
\begin{align*}
 	\Delta_{0} u &\coloneq \Delta u \\
 	D(\Delta_{0}) &\coloneq \{ u \in C_{0}(\Omega) \colon \Delta u \in C_{0}(\Omega) \}.
\end{align*}
%% --
Here $\Delta u$ is to be understood in the sense of distributions.

In this section we consider always real spaces.
Then a semigroup is called \emph{holomorphic} if its extension to the coerresponding complexification (here $ C_{0}( \Omega, \C ) $) is holomorphic.
%% --
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:eb2-4.1} % 4.1
The following are equivalent.
%% --
\begin{enumerate}[\upshape (a)]

\item 
$\Omega$ is Dirichlet regular;

\item  
$\Delta_{0}$ generates a positive semigroup $\mathcal{T}$ on $C_{0}(\Omega)$.

\end{enumerate}
%% -- 
In that case the semigroup $\mathcal{T}$ is holomorphic of angle $\pi/2$. 
Moreover $T(t)$ is compact for all $t > 0$.
If $\Omega$ is connected, then the semigroup is irreducible. 
Moreover,
%% --
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:en-4.1}
	\|T(t)\| \leq Me^{-\varepsilon t} \quad (t \geq 0)
\end{equation*}
%%
for some $\varepsilon > 0$, $M \geq 1$.
\end{theorem}
%% --
This result is due to \citet{ArBe99} besides irreducibility on which we comment later.
In Example C-II.1.5\,(e) the generation result was obtained if $\Omega$ has $C^{2}$-boundary.

The implication (a) $\Rightarrow$ (b) of Theorem 4.1 is proved below in order to show how the Dirichlet problem comes into play and leads to a result with minimal regularity assumptions on the boundary of $\Omega$.

We use the following abstract generation result which is of independent interest. 
By C-II, Theorem 1.2 a densely defined operator $A$ generates a contractive positive semigroup if and only if $A$ is dispersive and $(\lambda - A)$ is surjective for some $\lambda > 0$.
We now describe the case $\lambda = 0$.
%% --
\begin{theorem}
Let $A$ be a densely defined operator on a real or complex Banach lattice $E$. 
The following are equivalent.
%% --
\begin{enumerate}[\upshape (a)]
\item  
$A$ generates a positive, contractive semigroup and $s(A) < 0$.
\item  
$A$ is dispersive and surjective.
\end{enumerate}
%% --
In particular, (b) implies that $A$ is closed.
\end{theorem}
%% --
Dispersive operators are defined before C-II, Theorem 1.2. 
A densely defined operator $A$ on $C_{0}(\Omega)$ is dispersive if and only if for $u \in D(A)$, $x_{0} \in \overline{\Omega}$:
%% --
\[
	u(x_{0}) = \sup_{x \in \overline{\Omega}} u(x) > 0 \text{ implies } (Au)(x_{0}) \leq 0.
\]
%% --
\begin{proof}(of Theorem 4.2.) \\
(b) $\Rightarrow$ (a)
%% --
Consider the equivalent norm
%% --
\[
	\|u\|_1 \coloneq \|u^+\| + \|u^-\|
\]
%% --
on $E$. 
Since $A$ is dispersive it is dissipative with respect to this new norm as is easy to see. 
Now \citet[Theorem 4.5]{ACM24} implies that $A$ generates a contraction semigroup $\mathcal{T}$ and $A$ is invertible. 
Since $A$ is dispersive, it follows from C-II, Theorem 1.2 that $\TT$ is positive and contractive (with respect to the original norm). 
Since $R(\lambda, A) \geq 0$ for $\lambda > 0$, it follows that $-A^{-1} \geq 0$. Now C-I, Theorem 1.1 (vi) implies that $s(A) < 0$.

(a) $\Rightarrow$ (b) is obvious from C-II, Theorem 1.2. 
%% --
\end{proof}
%% --
\begin{proof}(of Theorem 4.1.)  \\
(a) $\Rightarrow$ (b)
%% --
The operator $\Delta_{0}$ is dispersive by the maximum principle. 
If $\Omega$ is Dirichlet regular, then $\Delta_{0}$ is surjective. 
In fact, let $f \in C_{0}(\Omega)$. 
Extend $f$ by $0$ to $\R^n$ and let $w = \Gamma * f$, where $\Gamma$ is the fundamental solution of Laplace's equation (see \citet[(2.12)]{GT83}). 
Then $w \in C(\R^n)$ and $\Delta w = f$ in the sense of distributions. 
Let $g = w_{|_{\Omega}}$ and let $v \in C^{2}(\overline{\Omega}) \cap C(\overline{\Omega})$ be the solution of the Dirichlet problem, \ie 
%
\[
	v_{|_{\Omega}} = g 
	\quad \text{and} \quad \Delta v = 0 \text{ in $\Omega$.}
\]
%
Then $u \coloneq w - v \in D(\Delta_{0})$ and $\Delta u = f$.

We have shown that $\Delta_{0}$ satisfies condition (b) of Theorem 4.2. 
Thus $\Delta_{0}$ generates a positive, contractive $C_{0}$-semigroup $(T(t))_{t \geq 0}$ on $C_{0}(\Omega)$ and $s(\Delta_{0}) < 0$. 
Since by C-IV Theorem 1.1 (iv) $s(\Delta_{0}) = \omega_{0}(\Delta_{0})$, it is exponentially stable.

We refer to \citet{ArBe99} for the proof of (b) $\Rightarrow$ (a).
%% --
\end{proof}
%% --
We want to add two further comments on the Dirichlet Laplacian $\Delta_{0}$ on $C_{0}(\Omega)$. 
The first concerns its domain
%% --
\[
	D(\Delta_{0}) = \{u \in C_{0}(\Omega) \colon \Delta u \in C_{0}(\Omega)\}.
\]
%% --
This distributional domain is not contained in $C^{2}(\Omega)$ for any open set $\Omega \subset \R^n$, $n \geq 2$, see \citet[Theorem 6.60]{Au23}. 

Our second comment concerns the proof of holomorphy. 
It can be given via Gaussian estimates (see the Extended Notes for C-II). 
In our context, a short proof based on Kato's inequality of C-II, Section 2 is more appealing (see \citet{ArBa92}).

Finally, we comment on irreducibility. 
On $C_{0}(\Omega)$ it is a strong property. 
By C-III, Theorem 3.2 (ii) it means that for $0 \leq f \in C_{0}(\Omega)$, $f \neq 0$,
%% --
\[
	(T(t)f)(x) > 0 \text{ for all } x \in \Omega, t > 0.
\]
%% --
On $L^{2}(\Omega)$ irreducibility is much weaker (meaning that $(T(t)f)(x) > 0$ $x$-a.e.), but easy to prove (see the Extended Notes to C-II). 
In \citet{AEG20} an argument based on Banach lattice techniques shows how irreducibility on $L^{2}(\Omega)$ can be carried over to $C_{0}(\Omega)$ or even to $C(\overline{\Omega})$ in the case of Robin boundary conditions which we consider now.

By %
\[
	H^{1}(\Omega) \coloneq \{u \in L^{2}(\Omega) \colon \partial_j u \in L^{2}(\Omega) 
	\text{ for } j = 1, \ldots, n\}
\]
%
we denote the first Sobolev space.
We assume that $\Omega$ has Lipschitz boundary. 
Then there exists a unique bounded operator 
%
\[
	\text{tr} \colon H^{1}(\Omega) \to L^{2}(\Omega)
\]
%
such that $\text{tr }(u) = u_{|_{\Omega}}$ for all $u \in C^{1}(\overline{\Omega})$. 
It is called the \emph{trace operator}.

Here the space $L^{2}(\Omega)$ is defined with respect to the surface measure (\ie the $(d-1)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure) on $\Omega$.

The normal derivative $\partial_\nu u$ of $u$ is defined as follows. Let $u \in H^{1}(\Omega)$ such that $\Delta u \in L^{2}(\Omega)$. Let $h \in L^{2}(\Omega)$. We say that $h$ is the \emph{(outer) normal derivative} of $u$ and write $\partial_\nu u = h$ if
\[\int_\Omega \Delta u v + \int_\Omega \nabla u \nabla v = \int_{\Omega} h v\]
for all $v \in C^{1}(\overline{\Omega})$.

If $u \in H^{1}(\Omega)$ such that $\Delta u \in L^{2}(\Omega)$ we say $\partial_\nu u \in L^{2}(\Omega)$ if there exists $h \in L^{2}(\Omega)$ such that $\partial_\nu u = h$.
%% --
\begin{remark*}
Since $\Omega$ has Lipschitz boundary the outer normal $\nu(z)$ exists for almost all $z \in \Omega$ and $\nu \in L^{\infty}(\Omega)$. 
But we do not use this outer normal and rather define $\partial_\nu u$ weakly by the validity of Green's formula.
\end{remark*}
%% --
Let $\beta \in L^{\infty}(\Omega)$. 
We define the Laplacian $\Delta^\beta$ with Robin boundary conditions as follows:
%% --
\begin{align*}
	D(\Delta^\beta) &\coloneq \{u \in H^{1}(\Omega) : \Delta u \in L^{2}(\Omega), \partial_\nu u + \beta 				\text{tr}(u) = 0\} \\
	\Delta^\beta u &\coloneq \Delta u.
\end{align*}
%% --
We call $\Delta^{\beta}$ briefly the \emph{Robin-Laplacian}. Note that for $\beta = 0$, we obtain Neumann boundary conditions, and $\Delta^{0} =: \Delta^{N}$ is the \emph{Neumann Laplacian}.

The following result is valid.
%% --
\begin{theorem}
Assume that $\Omega \subset \R^d$ is bounded, open, connected with Lipschitz boundary, and let $\beta \in L^{\infty}(\Omega)$. 
Then $\Delta^\beta$ generates a positive, irreducible, holomorphic semigroup $\mathcal{T} = (T(t))_{t \geq 0}$ on $C(\overline{\Omega})$. 
Moreover, $T(t)$ is compact for all $t > 0$.
\end{theorem}
%% --
%The generation property on $C(\overline{\Omega})$ is due to \citet{Ni11}. A major point is to show that the resolvent of the corresponding operator on $L^{2}(\Omega)$ leaves $C(\overline{\Omega})$ invariant. Given $f \in C(\overline{\Omega})$, $u \in H^{1}(\Omega)$ such that $u - \Delta u = f$, $\partial_\nu u + \beta u|_{\Omega} = 0$.
