An overview of positive operators on operator algebras can be found in \mycite{zbMATH06128372}, but there seems to be no systematic reference for general positive 
$C_{0}$-semigroups on operator algebras.
Many papers deal with Markov semigroups (see, \eg \mycite{zbMATH03762672}) or with so-called E-semigroups
(see \mycite{zbMATH01949821})
