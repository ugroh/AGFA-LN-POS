Our leitmotif in this chapter has been
\enquote{The spectrum of the generator $A$ determines the asymptotic behavior of the semigroup $(T(t))$.}

\begin{enumerate}[$\bullet$, wide, labelindent=.75em]

\item 

This is pursued in the monographs \mycite[Chapter V]{zbmath01354832}, 
\mycite[Sections 3 and 4]{zbmath00921898} and \mycite[Chapter III]{zbmath05625330}.
A different approach with emphasis on the resolvent of the generator is taken in 
\mycite[Chapter 5]{zbmath05842872} while  \mycite{zbmath05080033} provides a 
\enquote{non-spectral} asymptotic analysis.

\item
That a \enquote{countable imaginary spectrum} of the generator can imply strong stability of the semigroup has been discovered by  \mycite{zbmath04063855} and by \mycite{zbmath04042353}, see also
\mycite[Theorem 5.5.5]{zbmath05842872} or \mycite[Theorem 2.21]{zbmath01354832}.



Here we mention a basic result on stability as a special case of the ABLV-Theorem. 
Let $A$ be the generator of a bounded semigroup $(T(t))_{t\geq 0}$ on a reflexive Banach space $E$ such that the boundary spectrum is countable. 
Then the semigroup  $(T(t))_{t\geq 0}$ is stable (\ie converges strongly to $0$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$) if and only if there is no point spectrum on the imaginary line. 
An analogous result is valid for power bounded operators. 
We refer to \mycite[Theorem~5.5.5]{zbmath05842872} or \mycite[Theorem~2.21]{zbmath05051510}. 
While countability of the boundary spectrum  is not necessary for stability, 
\mycite{zbmath00410037} and \mycite{zbmath0493176} characterize countability in terms of \enquote{super stability} (\ie stability of all the semigroups induced on an ultra power of the underlying Banach space).

\item
There are more general versions of the ABLV-Theorem whith implications on the asymptotic behavior of the semigroup, we refer to \mycite[Theorem~2.21]{zbmath01354832} and \mycite[Theorem~5.5.5]{zbmath05842872}. 
They have applications to  positive semigroups where cyclicity of the boundary spectrum can be used (see the updated notes to Section C-IV).


\item
The asymptotic behaviour of a semigroup as $t \rightarrow \infty$  with respect to the weak topology is studied in 
\mycite{zbmath05491771} and in the monograph \mycite{zbmath05625330}.
