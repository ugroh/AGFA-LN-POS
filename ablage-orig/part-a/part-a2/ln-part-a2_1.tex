\chapter{Characterization of Semigroups on Banach Spaces}

In this chapter two different problems are treated:

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item 
to characterize generators of strongly continuous semigroups;
\item 
to characterize various properties of strongly continuous semigroups in terms of their generators.
\end{enumerate}

In Section 1 the first problem is solved by finding conditions on the Cauchy problem associated with $A$ and also by finding conditions on the resolvent of $A$.
The second problem is treated for a hierarchy of smoothness properties of the semigroup.

Contraction semigroups are considered in Section 2.
Here, the first problem has a simple and extremely useful solution: A densely defined operator $A$ is generator of a contraction semigroup if and only if $A$ is dissipative and satisfies a range condition.

Our approach is quite general.
We do not only consider contractions with respect to the norm but also with respect to \enquote{half-norms}.
This will allow us to obtain results on positive contraction semigroups simultaneously by choosing a suitable half-norm (cf.\ C-II,Sec.1).

The last section contains a surprising result: on certain Banach spaces (e.g., $L^{\infty}$) only bounded operators are generators of strongly continuous semigroups.
