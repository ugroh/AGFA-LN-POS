Then $\tilde{v}$ is a solution of (ACP).
It follows that $\tilde{v}(s) = T_{1}(s)f$ for all $s \geq 0$.
Hence $v = \eta(f)$.
We have shown that $\eta$ has a closed graph and so $\eta$ is continuous.
This implies the continuity of $T_{1}(t)$.
It remains to show that $A_{1}$ is the generator of $(T_{1}(t))_{t\geq0}$.

We first show that for $f \in D(A^{2})$ one has
%% -- 
\[
AT_{1}(t)f = T_{1}(t)Af. \tag{1.1}
\]

In fact, let $v(t) = f + \int_{0}^{t} u(s,Af) ds$.
Then $\dot{v}(t) = u(t,Af) = Af + \int_{0}^{t} Au(s,Af) ds = A(f + \int_{0}^{t} u(s,Af) ds) = Av(t)$.
Since $v(0) = f$, it follows that $v(t) = u(t,f)$.
Hence $Au(t,f) = Av(t) = \dot{v}(t) = u(t,Af)$.
This is (1.1).

Now denote by $B$ the generator of $(T_{1}(t))_{t\geq0}$.
For $f \in D(A^{2})$ we have

\[
\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{T_{1}(t)f - f}{t} = Af
\]
%% -- 
and by (1.1),
%% -- 
\[
\lim_{t \to 0} A \frac{T_{1}(t)f - f}{t} = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{T_{1}(t)Af - Af}{t} = A^{2}f \text{ in the norm of } E.
\]

Hence $\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{T_{1}(t)f - f}{t} = Af$ in the norm of $E_{1}$.

This shows that $A_{1} \subset B$.
In order to show the converse, let $f \in D(B)$.
Then $\lim_{t \to 0} A \frac{T_{1}(t)f - f}{t}$ exists in the norm of $E$.
Since $\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{T_{1}(t)f - f}{t} = Af$ in the norm of $E$, it follows that $Af \in D(A)$, since $A$ is closed.
Thus $f \in D(A^{2}) = D(A_{1})$.
We have shown that $B = A_{1}$.

(ii) implies (i).
Assume that $A_{1}$ is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup $(T_{1}(t))_{t\geq0}$ on $E_{1}$.
Let $f \in D(A)$ and set $u(t) = T_{1}(t)f$.
Then $u \in C([0,\infty),E)$ and $Au(\cdot) \in C([0,\infty),E)$.
Moreover, $\int_{0}^{t} u(s)ds = \int_{0}^{t} T_{1}(s)fds \in D(A_{1}) = D(A^{2})$ and $A\int_{0}^{t} u(s)ds = u(t) - u(0) = u(t) - f$ (by A-I, (1.3)).
Consequently, $u(t) = f + A\int_{0}^{t} u(s)ds = f + \int_{0}^{t} Au(s)ds$.
Hence $u \in C^{1}([0,\infty),E)$ and $\dot{u}(t) = Au(t)$.
Thus $u$ is a solution of (ACP).
We have shown existence.
