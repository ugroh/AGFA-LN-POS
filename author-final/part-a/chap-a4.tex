\chapter{Asymptotics of Semigroups on Banach Spaces}\label{chap:A-IV}


In this chapter we study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the initial value problem

\[
	\dot{u}(t) = Au(t) + F(t), \quad u(0) = f
\]

with respect to time $t \geq 0$.
Here $A$ will be a generator of a strongly continuous semigroup $(T(t))_{t\geq 0}$ on a Banach space $E$ and $F(\cdot)$ is a function from $\mathbb{R}_{+}$ with values in $E$.

In Section 1 we investigate whether and how fast a solution $T(\cdot)f$ of the homogeneous problem tends to the zero solution as $t \to \infty$.
In Section 2 we consider the long term behavior of the solutions of $(*)$ for different classes of forcing terms $F$.

\section{Stability: Homogeneous Case}

Let $(T(t))_{t\geq 0}$ be a semigroup on $E$ with generator $A$.
An initial value $f \in D(A)$ is called \emph{stable} if the solution $t \mapsto T(t)f$ of

\[
\dot{u}(t) = Au(t), \quad u(0) = f
\]

converges to zero as $t$ tends to infinity.
The semigroup is called \emph{stable} if every solution converges to zero; i.e., if every initial value $f \in D(A)$ is stable.

If the space $E$ is finite dimensional, then the stability of the semigroup implies that the decay is exponential.
More precisely, the statements

\item $\|T(t)f\| \to 0$ for every $f \in \mathbb{C}^n$,
\item $\|T(t)\| \leq Me^{-\omega t}$ for some $\omega > 0$
\end{enumerate}
