***MSC Classifications***

**Primary:** **47D06**

**Secondary:** **47B65**, **46B40**, **47A10**, **34G10**, **37L05**, **35K90**, **35B09**, **46L55**, **47L50**, 

**Justification:** 

- **47D06 (One-parameter semigroups and linear evolution equations)** reflects the central theme of the book, which is the theory of strongly continuous semigroups and their generators, with particular emphasis on spectral and asymptotic properties. Secondary classifications 
- **47B65 (Positive operators)** and **46B40 (Ordered normed spaces; Banach lattices)** capture the structural role of positivity and ordered Banach spaces that underpins large parts of the exposition.
- Spectral aspects are represented by **47A10 (Spectrum, resolvent)**. 
- The dynamical viewpoint, including flows associated with semigroups and stability phenomena, is reflected in **34G10 (General theory of ordinary differential equations)**, **37L05 (Infinite-dimensional dynamical systems)**, **35B09 (Positive Solutions of PDE)**
- Connections with abstract parabolic problems are covered by **35K90 (Abstract parabolic equations)**. 
- The final part of the book, devoted to positive semigroups on C*- and W*-algebras, motivates the inclusion of **46L55 (Noncommutative dynamical systems)** and **47L50 (Semigroups of operators in operator algebras)**.
